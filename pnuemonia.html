            Pneumonia is an infection in one or both lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The infection leads to inflammation in 
            the air sacs of the lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.

            What causes pneumonia?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Pneumonia happens when germs get into your lungs and cause an infection. The immune system’s reaction to clear the infection 
            results in inflammation of the lung’s air sacs (alveoli). This inflammation can eventually cause the air sacs to fill up with pus and liquids, causing pneumonia symptoms.
            Several types of infectious agents can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi
